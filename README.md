The Backend for the Web-Aplication SpotiQueue 
- This was created 10months ago, my first asp.net Api project, a lot should have been done differently.
- Now working on changing the code, so there is no need for hardcoded sensetiv information. 

Watch a demo here - https://youtu.be/YXbg9j6xO7Y

- SpotiQueue gives guests the opportunity to contribute with music wishes.
- QR code at the table gives access to the app
- Add song requests
- Vote function
- Winning proposals are sent to the playback queue

This Repository is an edited verison of the original, that had my personal tokens and connection to Azure. 

Take into considuration that you need to get your own Access Token, Refresh Token, ClientId, ClientSeectret and deviceID find out more on how you access them here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api

As for now this needs to be addded to ur local database.
